Project title : Quora Spam filter

Approach

1) Data Preparation: Preprocess the Quora question dataset by tokenizing the text and padding sequences to a fixed length.

2) Embedding Layer: Utilize pre-trained GloVe word embeddings to convert text data into numerical vectors, capturing semantic relationships between words.

3) Model Construction: Design a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture for spam classification, incorporating an embedding layer, LSTM layer, and output layer with sigmoid activation.

4) Model Training: Train the LSTM model on the preprocessed data, optimizing performance using binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

5) Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on a validation set using accuracy and loss metrics, assessing its ability to classify spam and non-spam questions accurately.


Conclusion

In this project, we developed a spam filter for Quora questions using a deep learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained word embeddings and LSTM networks, we were able to effectively capture the semantic meaning of questions and classify them as spam or non-spam. The model demonstrated promising results in accurately identifying spam questions, providing a valuable tool for improving the quality of content on Quora. Through further experimentation and optimization, this approach can be refined to achieve even better performance and scalability.
